# Project_ADAS_BEVfusion

Led the development of a comprehensive simulation for an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) utilizing lidar and camera data in Autoware.

Achievements include the implementation of real-time map integration, lane detection, car speed assessment, detection of various vehicle types, tracking of other vehicle speeds, and human detection.

The simulation transitioned from ROS2 and RVIZ to Autoware to align with client specifications, ultimately realizing the goal of creating a semi autonomous car in a simulated environment.
